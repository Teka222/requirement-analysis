# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is dedicated to exploring the concept of Requirement Analysis within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It covers key activities such as gathering, analyzing, documenting, and validating software requirements to ensure that the final product meets stakeholder expectations.

The purpose of this repository is to provide clear insights and resources related to requirement analysis, helping developers and project teams understand and implement this crucial phase effectively.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of systematically gathering, examining, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. It serves as a foundational phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that helps ensure the software developed aligns with business goals and user requirements.

During Requirement Analysis, the development team works closely with stakeholders to collect detailed requirements, clarify any ambiguities, and document these requirements clearly. This phase helps identify functional and non-functional requirements, assess feasibility, and set the scope for the project.

The importance of Requirement Analysis lies in its ability to minimize misunderstandings, reduce project risks, and prevent costly changes later in the development process. By thoroughly analyzing requirements upfront, teams can deliver software that meets user needs, on time and within budget.
